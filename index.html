    <h1> about me.</h1>
    <p> hi im mingo I am currently a senior from stem early college high school, I am earning an associate of arts 
    from Palo alto college and hope to soon after pursue a master’s degree in mechanical engineering. I chose this 
    major because ,I have always been fascinated with anything mechanical and would love to observe and comprehend
    their motions and functions. In my future I plan to open an automotive shop just like my dad did but with a better
    grasp on today’s technology. I hope to make a big impact on the world today and leave knowing that I did something 
    to inspire others that share the same if not different dream I have. .</p>
